                            <li>Your Responsibility to Avoid Obstacles. Tata Motors Limited needs to know that if you solve the AI Hackathon challenge there will not be any legal obstacles to completing the non-exclusive license of your rights to Hackathon, which is the only way that you can receive the Award. You agree to be responsible for avoiding obstacles to licensing all Intellectual Property and Work Product (altogether, the &quot;Solution IP&quot;) if you submit a Proposed Solution chosen as a winning Solution. You will not receive an Award if you cannot license the Solution IP on the terms set forth for any challenge and any other terms established by Tata Motors Limited.</li>

                            <li>Your Guarantee. You agree that if and when the time comes to license the Solution IP, you will give a guarantee (the &quot;Guarantee&quot;) that the license is lawful in exchange for the one-time payment of the Award to you alone, and that no consents, approvals or contracts that you did not already have before starting the AI Hackathon Challenge are necessary from or with anyone else, such as:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Your employer or your university;</li>
                                    <li>Any former employer or other entity you are or have been associated with or have a contract with regarding Intellectual Property you develop that would impede the grant of the license to Tata Motors Limited;</li>
                                    <li>Anyone collaborating with you on the development of the Solution IP;</li>
                                    <li>Anyone else whose Intellectual Property you use or incorporate in the Solution IP;</li>
                                    <li>Any government official, regulatory body or other authority (for example, if any of the Solution IP is within the scope of a technology export control law in your country prohibiting its transfer to AI Hackathon in the United States, or if the required licenses of the Solution IP are otherwise subject to public registration, review and/or approval)</li>
                                    <li>The holder of any lien (for example, if a bank or other creditor has obtained a mortgage or security interest in any of the Solution IP);</li>
                                    <li>Anyone who may be entitled to royalties or other payments relating to any of the Solution IP either by law or contract</li>
                                </ol>
                            
                            <li>Your Responsibility to Protect Potential Solution IP. In order to be eligible for an Award, during the period from when you begin work on the AI Hackathon Challenge until the expiration of the Time Period as set forth in the Challenge Statement, you shall not:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Grant away any rights in the Work Product or Proposed Solution you are developing (&quot;Potential Solution IP&quot;), or do anything else that would prevent you from granting the Option for a mutually agreed time period;</li>
                                <li>Reveal to any third party, except on terms of strict confidentiality, any information that relates to Potential Solution IP or do anything else likely to impair any of the Potential Solution IP; or</li>
                                <li>Do anything that would cause the failure of your Guarantee</li>
                            </ol>

                            <li>Acceptance of Proposed Solution and Grant of License in Intellectual Property

                                    <li>Acceptance. AI Hackathon will notify you within a reasonable period of time after the Deadline and before the termination of the mutually agreed mutually agreed Exclusivity Period whether Tata Motors Limited accepts your Proposed Solution and wishes to exercise an Option (&quot;Acceptance&quot;). For purposes of this Agreement, &quot;Acceptance&quot; shall mean the selection of your Proposed Solution by the Seeker as meeting the Solution Acceptance Criteria as set forth in the AI Hackathon Challenge Statements.

Solver acknowledges and agrees that AI Hackathon is not responsible for and has no liability for selection of a winning solver, if any. Solver further agrees to hold AI Hackathon legally harmless in regard to selection of a winning solver, if any. Solver agrees to hold AI Hackathon legally harmless for any advice it may provide as to the quality or suitability of submitted solutions and agrees to waive any claim against AI Hackathon for Solver&#39;s failure to win an award. The meeting of the Solution Acceptance Criteria does not mean that the Proposed Solution will be Accepted by Tata Motors Limited. In the event that your Proposed Solution is not Accepted within the Mutually agreed Exclusivity Period, the Exclusive Option Rights will terminate without further notice to you</li>
                                    <li>License. Upon Acceptance of your Proposed Solution by Tata Motors Limited and payment of an Award to you (see &quot;Payments&quot;), you hereby assign and convey to Tata Motors a non-exclusive, worldwide, unlimited, perpetual, and irrevocable license to use, make, have made, market, copy, modify, lease, sell, distribute, and create derivative works of the Proposed Solution and any Work Product that are related to the AI Hackathon Challenge. If you utilize any processes in development of the Work Product which are the subject of patent rights owned by you, you agree to grant to Tata Motors a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free right and license to practice any patented processes used in the Work Product, including the right to assign the foregoing license to Tata Motors Limited. Furthermore, you agree that you will, during the term of this Agreement and at any time thereafter, execute all papers and do all things deemed necessary by AI Hackathon or Tata Motors Limited to ensure that AI Hackathon and Tata Motors Limited acquires the licenses and rights set forth in this agreement.  Such cooperation and execution shall be performed without additional compensation to you. Upon payment of the Award, or termination of the Exclusive Option Rights for any reason, there will be no further obligations between you and Tata Motors with respect to the Proposed Solution, the Work Product, or the AI Hackathon Challenge, except for the limitations on use and disclosure described under &quot;Confidentiality&quot;</li>
                                </ol>
                            
                            <li>Transfers. The transfers of the non-exclusive license of Solution IP and the Award or any Revised Award Amount (as determined by Seeker) will be as follows:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Your grant of the non-exclusive license of the Solution IP will be to AI Hackathon. The non-exclusive license of the Solution IP will be transferred to the Tata Motors Limited upon the occurrence of (a) the completion of AI Hackathon verification of you; (b) the Tata Motors Limited’s payment of the Award to AI Hackathon; and (c) the Tata Motors Limited’s payment of any other fees of AI Hackathon</li>
                                </ol>

                            <li>Payments. If Tata Motors Limited Accepts your Proposed Solution, the payment amount (called an &quot;Award&quot;) specified in the AI Hackathon Challenge posted on the site shall be paid to you by Tata Motors Limited within a mutually agreed timeframe and after occurrence of each of the following:  1) you are notified by AI Hackathon of your Proposed Solution’s Acceptance, and 2) the completion of certain verification procedures by AI Hackathon, and review and acceptance of such results by Tata Motors Limited, and 3) AI Hackathon receipt of Award payment from the Tata Motors Limited.

AI Hackathon is not responsible for payment of any Award, or any part of any Award, to any party other than to the Solver through whom the Proposed Solution was submitted to the Service. You understand that the Award represents a complete payment, net of any local taxes that AI Hackathon may be required to withhold, for any Accepted Proposed Solution and that you are not entitled to any other compensation of any kind. If local law does not require withholding of taxes, all taxes on Awards shall be your sole responsibility. </li>
