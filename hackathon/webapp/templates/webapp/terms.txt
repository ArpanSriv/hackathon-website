<li>TML makes no warranties or representations about the accuracy or completeness of this Site's content or the content of any site to which a link is provided on this Site</li>
<li>Your Responsibility to Avoid Obstacles. TML needs to know that if you solve the Tata Motors Hackathon challenge there will not be any legal obstacles to completing the non-exclusive license of your rights to Hackathon, which is the only way that you can receive the Award. You agree to be responsible for avoiding obstacles to licensing all Intellectual Property and Work Product (altogether, the "Solution IP") if you submit a Proposed Solution chosen as a winning Solution. You will not receive an Award if you cannot license the Solution IP on the terms set forth for any challenge and any other terms established by TML. </li>
<li>Your Guarantee. You agree that if and when the time comes to license the Solution IP, you will give a guarantee (the "Guarantee") that the license is lawful in exchange for the one-time payment of the Award to you alone, and that no consents, approvals or contracts that you did not already have before starting the Tata Motors Hackathon Challenge are necessary from or with anyone else, such as:</li>
<ol><li>Your employer or your university;</li>
<li>Any former employer or other entity you are or have been associated with or have a contract with regarding Intellectual Property you develop that would impede the grant of the license to TML;</li>
<li>Anyone collaborating with you on the development of the Solution IP;</li>
<li>Anyone else whose Intellectual Property you use or incorporate in the Solution IP;</li>
<li>Any government official, regulatory body or other authority (for example, if any of the Solution IP is within the scope of a technology export control law in your country prohibiting its transfer to Tata Motors Hackathon in the United States, or if the required licenses of the Solution IP are otherwise subject to public registration, review and/or approval)</li>
<li>The holder of any lien (for example, if a bank or other creditor has obtained a mortgage or security interest in any of the Solution IP);</li>
<li>Anyone who may be entitled to royalties or other payments relating to any of the Solution IP either by law or contract</li>
<li>Your Responsibility to Protect Potential Solution IP. In order to be eligible for an Award, during the period from when you begin work on the Tata Motors Hackathon Challenge until the expiration of the Time Period as set forth in the Challenge Statement, you shall not:</li>
<li>Grant away any rights in the Work Product or Proposed Solution you are developing ("Potential Solution IP"), or do anything else that would prevent you from granting the Option for a mutually agreed time period;</li>
<li>Reveal to any third party, except on terms of strict confidentiality, any information that relates to Potential Solution IP or do anything else likely to impair any of the Potential Solution IP; or</li>
<li>Do anything that would cause the failure of your Guarantee</li>
<li>Acceptance of Proposed Solution and Grant of License in Intellectual Property</li>
<li>Acceptance. Tata Motors Hackathon will notify you within a reasonable period of time after the Deadline and before the termination of the mutually agreed mutually agreed Exclusivity Period whether TML accepts your Proposed Solution and wishes to exercise an Option ("Acceptance"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Acceptance" shall mean the selection of your Proposed Solution by the Seeker as meeting the Solution Acceptance Criteria as set forth in the Tata Motors Hackathon Challenge Statements. The Seeker has absolute and sole discretion to determine whether to Accept your Proposed Solution, or any Proposed Solution, and whether to make an Award, multiple Awards or any Award. Solver acknowledges and agrees that Tata Motors Hackathon is not responsible for and has no liability for selection of a winning solver, if any. Solver further agrees to hold Tata Motors Hackathon legally harmless in regard to selection of a winning solver, if any. Solver agrees to hold Tata Motors Hackathon legally harmless for any advice it may provide as to the quality or suitability of submitted solutions and agrees to waive any claim against Tata Motors Hackathon for Solver's failure to win an award. The meeting of the Solution Acceptance Criteria does not mean that the Proposed Solution will be Accepted by TML. In the event that your Proposed Solution is not Accepted within the Mutually agreed Exclusivity Period, the Exclusive Option Rights will terminate without further notice to you</li>
<li>License. Upon Acceptance of your Proposed Solution by TML and payment of an Award to you (see "Payments"), you hereby assign and convey to Tata Motors a non-exclusive, worldwide, unlimited, perpetual, and irrevocable license to use, make, have made, market, copy, modify, lease, sell, distribute, and create derivative works of the Proposed Solution and any Work Product that are related to the Tata Motors Hackathon Challenge. If you utilize any processes in development of the Work Product which are the subject of patent rights owned by you, you agree to grant to Tata Motors a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free right and license to practice any patented processes used in the Work Product, including the right to assign the foregoing license to TML. Furthermore, you agree that you will, during the term of this Agreement and at any time thereafter, execute all papers and do all things deemed necessary by Tata Motors Hackathon or TML to ensure that Tata Motors Hackathon and TML acquires the licenses and rights set forth in this agreement. &nbsp;Such cooperation and execution shall be performed without additional compensation to you.

<li>Transfers. The transfers of the non-exclusive license of Solution IP and the Award or any Revised Award Amount (as determined by Seeker) will be as follows:</li>
<li>Your grant of the non-exclusive license of the Solution IP will be to Tata Motors Hackathon.

Payment of any Award is conditioned upon your cooperation with Tata Motors Hackathon verification procedures. The Award will be paid to you locally, in Indian Rupees, or if required by your local law, in your local currency equivalent based on the foreign exchange rate in effect on the date of the disbursement by Tata Motors Hackathon. Tata Motors Hackathon is not responsible for payment of any Award, or any part of any Award, to any party other than to the Solver through whom the Proposed Solution was submitted to the Service.
