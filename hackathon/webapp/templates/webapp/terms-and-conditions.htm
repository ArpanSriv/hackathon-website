            <li>Any former employer or other entity you are or have been associated with or have a contract with

            </li>
            <li>The holder of any lien (for example, if a bank or other creditor has obtained a mortgage or security

        from when you begin work on the AI Hackathon Challenge until the expiration of the Time Period as set forth in
        the Challenge Statement, you shall not:
        <ol>
            <li>Grant away any rights in the Work Product or Proposed Solution you are developing (&quot;Potential
                Solution IP&quot;), or do anything else that would prevent you from granting the Option for a mutually
                agreed time period;
            </li>
            <li>Reveal to any third party, except on terms of strict confidentiality, any information that relates to
                Potential Solution IP or do anything else likely to impair any of the Potential Solution IP; or

            <li>Acceptance. AI Hackathon will notify you within a reasonable period of time after the Deadline and
                before the termination of the mutually agreed mutually agreed Exclusivity Period whether Tata Motors
                Limited accepts your Proposed Solution and wishes to exercise an Option (&quot;Acceptance&quot;). For
                purposes of this Agreement, &quot;Acceptance&quot; shall mean the selection of your Proposed Solution by

                Statements. The Seeker has absolute and sole discretion to determine whether to Accept your Proposed
                Solution, or any Proposed Solution, and whether to make an Award, multiple Awards or any Award. Solver
                acknowledges and agrees that AI Hackathon is not responsible for and has no liability for selection of a
                winning solver, if any. Solver further agrees to hold AI Hackathon legally harmless in regard to
                selection of a winning solver, if any. Solver agrees to hold AI Hackathon legally harmless for any
                advice it may provide as to the quality or suitability of submitted solutions and agrees to waive any
                claim against AI Hackathon for Solver&#39;s failure to win an award. The meeting of the Solution
                Acceptance Criteria does not mean that the Proposed Solution will be Accepted by Tata Motors Limited. In
                the event that your Proposed Solution is not Accepted within the Mutually agreed Exclusivity Period, the
                Exclusive Option Rights will terminate without further notice to you

                sell, distribute, and create derivative works of the Proposed Solution and any Work Product that are
                related to the AI Hackathon Challenge. If you utilize any processes in development of the Work Product
                which are the subject of patent rights owned by you, you agree to grant to Tata Motors a worldwide,
                non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free right and license to practice any patented processes used in the
                Work Product, including the right to assign the foregoing license to Tata Motors Limited. Furthermore,
                you agree that you will, during the term of this Agreement and at any time thereafter, execute all
                papers and do all things deemed necessary by AI Hackathon or Tata Motors Limited to ensure that AI
                Hackathon and Tata Motors Limited acquires the licenses and rights set forth in this agreement. Such
                cooperation and execution shall be performed without additional compensation to you. Upon payment of the
                Award, or termination of the Exclusive Option Rights for any reason, there will be no further
                obligations between you and Tata Motors with respect to the Proposed Solution, the Work Product, or the
                AI Hackathon Challenge, except for the limitations on use and disclosure described under &quot;Confidentiality&quot;
            </li>
